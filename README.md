# Wolffe Bricks
## About this repository
This is probably one of the final versions of Wolffe Bricks. I found the framework which I will probably use in the future: [**SvelteKit**](https://kit.svelte.dev). \
Porting this app to SvelteKit is a huge step in my development journey and I am glad I chose [Skeleton UI](https://skeleton.dev) to help me with that. \
SvelteKit will not only allow me to bring the backend and frontend closer together, because it, is compared to React, a full-stack framework. SvelteKit's efficient routing system also comes in handy.

## Technologies used
- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- Skeleton UI
- Stripe

## Roadmap
- [x] Misc
- [x] Card Logic
- [ ] Backend (API route)
- [ ] Database (probably Supabase with Drizzle as ORM) for storing users (auth) and other page data
